# ascii-characters-split64.py
In computer programming ASC means American Standard Code then the asc ii characters and corresponding bit value is produced by them.
we have code in python to represent the ascii characters 
  in python we have built in function chr() gives or gets the ascii character of any number or value which is less than 257 now a days we have a extended ascii characters upto the values 1024 
  for example if we input chr(23) then we get the ascii chracter for the number 23 is '\x17'
  we have the program to split 256 ascii characters into lists
  [0,64,128,192]
  list1=[ascii characters for the range 0 to 63]
  list2=[ascii characters for the range 64 to 127]
  list3=[ascii characters for the range 128 to 191]
  list4=[ascii characters for the range 192 to 255]
